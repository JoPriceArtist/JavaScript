  <summary>Marking Criteria</summary>
<br>
The following Learning Outcomes are assessed using the below criteria:

<table>
  
  <tr>
    <td>LO4</td>
    <td>Demonstrate programming using logic, computational thinking and fundamental mathematical concepts, abstract reasoning and systems thinking.</td>
    <td>1 Credit<br>(3.33%)</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>LO11</td>
    <td>Select and apply multiple plug-in solutions.</td>
    <td>1 Credit<br>(3.33%)</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td colspan="2">Total credit weighting counting towards the final grade of WDD01</td>
    <td>2 Credits<br>(6.66%)</td>
  </tr>
</table>

To receive the LO credits - all summative projects must receive a C- Grade (50% or higher).

## Brief

Use your inference skills and code comprehension skills to implement the desired functionality that the documentation is expecting.

Your task is to complete the functions in `submission.js` so that the tests pass and the functionality matches it's documentation.

## Getting started

In `submission/submission.js`, you fill find several empty functions.
The parameters and outputs of these functions are described using JSDoc.
You can run `npm install` and `npm run doc:serve` to view the functions in a nice way.

Please run `npm test` to run the unit tests.  You can inspect `test/submission.test.js` to view what tests are being run.

You may use Jest Command line arguments to run or watch individual tests.
A test report will be generated at test-report.html - you can view this using live server if it helps you!

Do not alter `test/submission.test.js`.


## Rationale

In addition to building full-stack apps we need to keep practicing our basic javascript objects and functions,
and get quick at learning how to apply them to real-life scenarios.
We'll also practice using test runners.

## Part A

Run JSDoc and read the documentation for the functions and objects.

Complete the `countOfbobs` function in `submission.js` so that it matches the functions params, return values and function name. The relevant test(s) should pass.

## Part B
Complete the `peopleWhoCanVote` function in `submission.js` so that it matches the functions params, return values and function name. The relevant test(s) should pass.

## Part C
Complete the `transformForApi` function in `submission.js` so that it matches the functions params, return values and function name. The relevant test(s) should pass.

## Part D
Complete the `personIsValid` function in `submission.js` so that it matches the functions params, return values and function name. The relevant test(s) should pass.

## Part E
Complete the `oldestPerson` function in `submission.js` so that it matches the functions params, return values and function name. The relevant test(s) should pass.

## Part F
Complete the `numberBusesRequired` function in `submission.js` so that it matches the functions params, return values and function name. The relevant test(s) should pass.
